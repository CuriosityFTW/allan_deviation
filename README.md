**My contributions:**
* Developed sensor failsafe algorithms in ArduPilot to extend agricultural spray operation of a 49 kg drone
* Modeled gyroscope using Allan variance analysis to estimate yaw drift and bias instability values
* Extended drone's mission continuation time by 7 minutes via flight test validations
